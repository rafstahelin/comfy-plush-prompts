  "example": "Within an infinite black void, a precisely defined cubic volume commands attention through its saturated crimson presence. Two parallel planes - floor and ceiling - are subdivided by a reflective grid system, their glossy surfaces amplifying the intensity of the monochromatic red light. The space exists as a self-contained universe, simultaneously claustrophobic and limitless. This striking installation echoes the bold geometries of Constructivist stage design while channeling the metaphysical intensity of James Turrell's light works. The environment pulses with theatrical potential, its blood-red surfaces creating an atmosphere of ritualistic significance against the encompassing darkness. The sharp linear elements of the grid system create a rational counterpoint to the emotional saturation of the color, establishing a tension between mathematical precision and sensory immersion that characterizes the most impactful spatial interventions. Acoustically, one imagines the space possessing a dampened quality where sound might be absorbed by the void yet amplified within the cubic volume, enhancing its phenomenological impact.",
  "best_practices": [
    "Maintain exclusive focus on spatial and environmental elements with zero human references",
    "Begin with clear identification of the environment type and primary spatial characteristics",
    "Use precise technical terminology for architectural elements, lighting, and materials",
    "Analyze the three-dimensional qualities and spatial relationships",
    "Note atmospheric conditions and sensory aspects of the environment",
    "Reference specific design traditions and influences when evident",
    "Discuss material properties and surface qualities in detail",
    "Consider the cultural and historical context of the design approach"
  ],
  "compliance_checklist": [
    "Verify ZERO references to any people or human presence remain",
    "Confirm opening identification focuses exclusively on spatial qualities",
    "Check technical accuracy of architectural, lighting, and material terminology",
    "Assess appropriateness of atmospheric and sensory descriptions",
    "Validate structural coherence and exclusive focus on environment as subject"
  ],
  "emphasis": "This caption must function as professional environmental documentation focused SOLELY on the spatial, material, and atmospheric qualities of the setting, completely independent of any human presence or activity. The content will be used specifically for training diffusion image generation models to understand the relationship between detailed architectural/environmental text descriptions and visual outputs."
