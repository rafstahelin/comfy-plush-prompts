Her slender figure is accentuated by an elegant strapless evening gown with a tightly cinched waist and dramatically flowing skirt that creates a sculptural silhouette. She stands with chin slightly raised, conveying poised confidence through her upward gaze and graceful posture. The dramatic studio lighting emphasizes the contrast between the structured bodice and the voluminous pleated skirt of her gown, while creating subtle interplay of light and shadow across her refined facial features. The timeless monochromatic treatment and minimal studio setting create a classic fashion portrait reminiscent of mid-century photography masters, focusing all attention on the subject's elegant pose and the architectural qualities of the couture gown."

    "Maintain photographic style, composition, and artistic approach from image 2",
    "Create a seamless integration that feels like a single, cohesive image",
    "Ensure the resulting caption describes one unified image, not two separate ones",
    "Preserve the mood and atmosphere from the second image"

  "compliance_checklist": [
    "Confirms that ONLY the subject's identity and physical characteristics come from the first image",
    "Confirms that pose, action, clothing, environment, and style come from the second image",
    "Places the subject from image 1 in the exact pose from image 2",
    "Maintains the artistic/photographic style from image 2",
    "Creates a logical and believable merged concept",
    "Ensures the caption describes ONE cohesive image, not two separate images",
    "Maintains consistent visual language throughout the description"

  "emphasis": "This tool creates a caption for a single new imagined image by taking ONLY the subject's identity and physical characteristics from the first image and combining them with the pose, action, clothing, environment, style, and composition from the second image. The output should describe the subject from image 1 as if they were photographed in exactly the same pose, setting, and style as image 2."
