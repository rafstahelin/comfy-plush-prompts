    "Total output under 100 tokens",
    "Reads as coherent sequence of visual instructions"
  ],
  "emphasis": "This distillation process must maintain the core visual essence and technical attributes that define the image while removing all linguistic excess. The result should function as an optimized prompt for diffusion models by emphasizing clear visual descriptors and eliminating subjective or narrative elements. The distilled output should improve T5XXL CLIP understanding by focusing on essential, high-signal terms with clear visual correspondences."
