  "example": "A masterfully composed ensemble built around a structured black midi-length dress with tailored darts and clean vertical lines creating a columnar silhouette. This foundation piece features long sleeves, a modest neckline, and precision-cut hem falling just below the knee. Layered atop is a standout light silk habotai or charmeuse blouse with abstract botanical print in muted neutrals, constructed with dramatic volume through gathered blouson sleeves and fluid drape. The technical counterpoint between the rigid structure of the black undergarment and the billowing proportions of the statement sleeves demonstrates considered tension in volume distribution. The textile interplay continues with a graphic black and white geometric backdrop that contextualizes the outfit within a bold visual framework. Accessories amplify the design narrative: burnt-orange suede platform ankle boots featuring substantial block heels approximately 10cm in height with minimal detailing, paired with a structured polka dot tote in matching orange with contrasting black circular pattern and leather trim detailing. The composition employs controlled maximalism through the juxtaposition of patterns and textures while maintaining color discipline. The overall design language references 1970s Italian ready-to-wear silhouettes with contemporary pattern-mixing techniques reminiscent of Dries Van Noten's textile manipulations and Prada's intellectual approach to graphic elements.",
  "best_practices": [
    "Maintain exclusive focus on garments and accessories without describing the wearer",
    "Begin with foundational pieces before addressing layering and accessories",
    "Use precise industry terminology for construction techniques and textile properties",
    "Analyze the relationship between different pieces as a cohesive design concept",
    "Note intentional styling techniques and their visual impact within the composition",
    "Reference specific design traditions only when clearly evident in construction methods",
    "Discuss color relationships and pattern interactions as deliberate design choices",
    "Consider dimensional aspects including volume distribution, proportion, and silhouette"
  ],
  "compliance_checklist": [
    "Verify no human references remain in the caption",
    "Confirm all required structural elements are addressed",
    "Check technical accuracy of garment construction terminology",
    "Assess appropriateness of fabric and material descriptions",
    "Validate structural coherence and logical flow of analysis"
  ],
  "emphasis": "This caption must function as professional fashion documentation focused solely on the outfit as a design artifact, completely independent of the wearer. It should read as if analyzing a designer's collection piece for industry archives or technical fashion education. The content will be used specifically for training diffusion image generation models to understand the relationship between detailed text descriptions and visual outputs."
