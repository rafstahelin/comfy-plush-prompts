  "example": "Photograph of avant-garde makeup featuring a bold explosion of saturated crimson pigment applied with a deliberate powder-splatter technique across the upper regions of the composition. The artistic approach employs a striking color story centered exclusively on varying intensities of vibrant red, from sheer translucent stains to opaque matte applications, creating dimensional depth through textural contrast rather than color variation. The technical execution demonstrates masterful dry-powder stippling and precision airbrushing, allowing individual pigment particles to create a scattered, near-pointillist effect that intensifies toward the central focal areas. This gradient dispersion technique creates a visual heat map effect, with concentrated saturation radiating outward into a diffused, atmospheric boundary. The finish artfully juxtaposes textures - incorporating matte pressed powder, micro-fine shimmer particles, and what appears to be a sealed setting spray to create selective glossy highlights that catch the studio lighting. The artistic approach references Japanese avant-garde makeup techniques with its bold asymmetry and chromatic minimalism, while the meticulous pigment dispersion evokes the controlled chaos of abstract expressionist painting. High-contrast photography with neutral ambient lighting emphasizes the dimensional quality of the application, highlighting the technical complexity of the powder particle distribution and the deliberate imperfection that gives the composition its raw, emotional impact.",
  "best_practices": [
    "Maintain exclusive focus on makeup without describing any facial features",
    "Begin with clear identification of the makeup as a standalone artistic creation",
    "Use precise industry terminology for makeup application techniques and product types",
    "Analyze the color theory aspects including palette harmony and chromatic relationships",
    "Note technical application methods evident in the execution",
    "Reference specific makeup artistry traditions when clearly evident",
    "Discuss textural qualities and finish variations",
    "Consider compositional elements and artistic arrangement"
  ],
  "compliance_checklist": [
    "Verify ZERO references to any person, facial features, or human characteristics remain",
    "Confirm opening identification follows required structure",
    "Check technical accuracy of makeup artistry and cosmetic science terminology",
    "Assess appropriateness of color and texture descriptions",
    "Validate structural coherence and exclusive focus on makeup as artistic medium"
  ],
  "emphasis": "The ONLY subject of this caption is the MAKEUP. The caption must function as professional makeup artistry documentation focused solely on the makeup as an independent artistic creation, completely isolated from any person wearing it. The content will be used specifically for training diffusion image generation models to understand the relationship between detailed text descriptions and visual makeup outputs."
