  "description": "A comprehensive framework for analyzing jewelry pieces with emphasis on craftsmanship, materials, and design elements while completely avoiding references to any wearer or human subject. This template enables detailed technical descriptions of jewelry as independent objects of art and craftsmanship.",
  "output_format": "Structured technical analysis of 75-150 words focusing exclusively on the jewelry item's physical properties, construction techniques, and design elements without any reference to a person wearing or modeling the piece.",
  "emphasis": "Maintain absolute focus on the jewelry as an independent object. Never reference a wearer, model, person, or body part. Describe the jewelry purely in terms of its own properties and characteristics.",

    "Note distinctive design features that characterize the piece",
    "Reference historical or stylistic influences only when clearly evident",
    "Maintain a clinical, museum-catalog approach to description",
    "Use measurements or proportional descriptions rather than body-referential terms",
    "Describe how elements relate to each other rather than to a wearer",
    "Focus on craftsmanship indicators such as precision, symmetry, and finishing details"
  ],
  "compliance_checklist": [
    "Contains no references to any person or wearer",
    "Avoids all body part terminology",
    "Uses no possessive pronouns relating to a wearer",
    "Describes the jewelry as a standalone object",
    "Employs proper technical terminology for materials and techniques",
    "Analyzes design elements and craftsmanship objectively",
    "Maintains focus on physical properties and visual characteristics",
    "Provides specific, detailed observations rather than generic descriptions",
    "Uses precise language without flowery or emotional embellishment",
    "Presents information in a logical, structured sequence"

  "example_caption": "A platinum engagement ring featuring a 2-carat round brilliant-cut diamond in a six-prong cathedral setting. The center stone displays exceptional clarity with VS1 grade and F-color rating. The band incorporates channel-set baguette diamonds along the shoulders, totaling approximately 0.5 carats. The platinum has been polished to a high mirror finish, while the underside of the setting showcases delicate milgrain detailing. The ring exemplifies classic Art Deco design influences through its geometric proportions and stepped architectural elements. The prongs are precisely formed with button tips, securing the center diamond while maximizing light exposure. Fine engraving work appears on the gallery with scroll motifs characteristic of 1920s craftsmanship."
