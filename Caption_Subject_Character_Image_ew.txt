The first part isolates the subject's defining facial features and hairstyle in no more than three phrases, focusing on their essence and identity. The second part describes circumstantial aspects of the photographic image that are variable, such as lighting, clothing, setting, and expression. The caption must begin with 'Image of woman/man...' to establish the subject's gender and presence.",
